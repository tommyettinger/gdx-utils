divided project in a root and subproject because box2d was moved to an extension

+++ 197 +++
added Box2DUtils#split(..) (splits bodies, fixtures and shapes)

+++ 183 +++
now using Gradle

+++ 2014-03-12_17:38:39 +++

Restructured Box2DUtils. Ignore what I said about the cache in the entry of 2014-02-17_22:01:57, it's back to what it was before.

+++ 2014-02-18_01:57:31 +++
Fixed Box2DUtils#position(Shape, Body).

+++ 2014-02-17_22:01:57 +++
I rewrote most of Box2DUtils to fix issue #4. You now clear the cache differently: Box2DUtils.getCache().clear(). You can also set and get your own ShapeCache instances. If you set null, caching will not be used.

The Box2DMapObjectParser doesn't require map objects to have a name anymore (issue #2).

+++ 2014-01-11_18:55:33 +++
Compiled with java 1.6 to avoid problems with Android.

Rope was renamed to Chain because this is a more general name. Also the Chain$Builder#createSegment method takes different arguments.
If you used the Rope/Chain, you will have to adapt to this.

+++ 2013-12-16_03:34:03 +++
Many convenience methods and bugfixes.

+++ 2013-12-15_10:38:57 +++
Autopilot#movementForce is now a Vector2 to allow you to specify a different force for each axis.
If you used the Autopilot, you'll have to adapt to the changes.

+++ 2013-12-15_00:00:36 +++
Box2DMapObjectParser now inherits from MapLayers, allows you to properly use its methods yourself, fixed some bugs or inconveniences.
Autopilot makes a bit more sense with its methods.
Everything is update to the latest nightly, so because of the change from SpriteBatch to Batch, you might have to update your libs as well. Read more here: http://badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=7019

Fixed an important bug in MouseJointAdapter. This fix made its brute iteration mode completely unnecessary, so it was removed.

+++ 2013-12-08_04:45:45 +++
Added net.dermefan.utils.libgdx.box2d.Rope. A Rope consists of Bodies and Joints holding them together.
The bodies and joints are fully customizable (in fact, the user has to define them). This is done using the Rope$Builder interface and some helping subclasses of Builder that can be extended or used instantly.
A Rope can be created from nothing to build it using the Builder or it can be created from an array of already existing Bodies (use varargs constructor). In any case a Builder is needed that will be used in the modification methods like #insert(int), #remove(int), #split(int) and some more.

I added the Autopilot. It does what its name suggests with Box2D bodies. Let them fly around!

+++ 2013-11-11_19:44:39 +++
The packages net.dermetfan.util.* were renamed to net.dermetfan.utils.*.
You will have to update your imports!

Once you put the new jars in your project, you should see that some of your classes get errors.
Don't worry. Just open the class, press ctrl + shift + o and eclipse will update your imports.
If it asks you which class you mean (in case there are other classes with the same name), make sure to select the correct one.

I'm sorry for this inconvenience, but I just had to rename it. Please forgive me.
